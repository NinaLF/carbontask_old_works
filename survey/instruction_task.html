    <p>
        In the following we will ask you to judge the carbon intensity of different carbon foorprints. <br>
        This means giving your best educated guess about <b>how much carbon emissions (CO2) you think the presented carbon footprint produces </b>.  <br>
        You will be asked to make this judgment on a <b>scale from 1 to 10</b>, so you do not have to estimate any numbers. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        On average a persons carbon footprint in xx is about <b>xxxxx tons</b>  .<br>
        The carbon footprints you will see are reduced to 6 behaviors, so they do not equal a full carbon footprint of consumption a person produces.<br>

        In our task a very high carbon footprint based on the 6 behaviors would equal about 6 tons of CO2 and a small carbon footprint about 1 ton of CO2
    </p>
    <p>
        Next you will see how the task will look like.<br>
        Then you will make <b> 24</b> of these ratings. <br>
        Each time evaluating how much carbon emissions each carbon footprint produces <br>
        on a scale from </i>1 (very little)</i> to  <i> 10 (very much)</i>
